# Gemika [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makandra/gemika.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makandra/gemika)

## Test a Ruby gem against multiple versions of everything

Gemika helps you test your gem against multiple versions of Ruby, gem dependencies and database types.

## Features

Here's what Gemika can give your test's development setup (all features are opt-in):

- Test one codebase against multiple sets of runtime gem dependency sets (e.g. Rails 2.3, Rails 5.0).
- Test one codebase against multiple Ruby versions (e.g. Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 2.3.10).
- Test one codebase against multiple database types (currently MySQL or PostgreSQL).
- Compute a matrix of all possible dependency permutations (Ruby, runtime gems, database type). Manually exclude incompatible dependency permutations (e.g. Rails 5.0 does not work with Ruby 2.1).
- Let developers enter their local credentials for MySQL and PostgreSQL in a `database.yml` file.
- Define default Ruby version, gem dependencies and database for developers who don't care about every possible permutation for everyday work.
- Help configure a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) build that tests every dependency permutation after each `git push`.
- Share your Ruby / gem dependeny / database permutation between local development and Travis CI.
- Define an [ActiveRecord database migration](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html) that sets up your test database.
- Automatically drop and re-create your test database before each run of your test suite.
- Work around breaking changes in RSpec, Ruby and other gems


## Compatibility

Gemika currently supports the following dependency versions:

- Ruby: 1.8.7, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
- RSpec: Versions 1, 2, 3
- ActiveRecord: Versions 2.3, 3.2, 4.2, 5.0
- Databases: PostgreSQL (with `pg` gem), MySQL or MariaDB (with `mysql2` gem)

Gemika also makes some assumption about your Gem:

- You're testing with [RSpec](http://rspec.info/).
- If you use any database-related features, you need `activerecord` as a development dependency


## Example directory structure

Below you can see the directory of a gem with a completed Gemika testing setup. The next section describes how to get there:

```shell
gemfiles/Gemfile.set1                       # First dependency set. Should include development dependencies and gemika.
gemfiles/Gemfile.set1.lock                  # Generated by `rake matrix:install`
gemfiles/Gemfile.set2                       # Second dependency set. Should include development dependencies and gemika.
gemfiles/Gemfile.set2.lock                  # Generated by `rake matrix:install`
gemfiles/Gemfile.set3                       # Third dependency set. Should include development dependencies and gemika.
gemfiles/Gemfile.set3.lock                  # Generated by `rake matrix:install`
Gemfile -> gemfiles/Gemfile.set2            # Symlink to default Gemfile for development
Gemfile.lock -> gemfiles/Gemfile.set2.lock  # Symlink to default Gemfile.lock for development
.ruby-version                               # Default Ruby version for development
.gitignore                                  # Should ignore spec/support/database.yml
.travis.yml                                 # Configures all tested Ruby / gemfile combinations, for both local development and Travis CI
my_gem.gemspec                              # Specification for your gem
Rakefile                                    # Should require 'gemika/tasks'
README.md                                   # README for your gem
lib/my_gem.rb                               # Main file to require for your gem
lib/my_gem/my_class.rb                      # Class delivered by your gem
lib/my_gem/version.rb                       # Version definition for your gem
spec/spec_helper.rb                         # Requires 'gemika' and all files in support folder
spec/support/database.rb                    # Database schema for test database
spec/support/database.yml                   # Database credentials for local development (not checked in)
spec/support/database.sample.yml            # Sample database credentials for new developers
spec/support/database.travis.yml            # Database credentials for Travis CI
spec/my_gem/my_class_spec.rb                # Tests for your gem
```

For a live example of this setup, check the [makandra/minidusen](https://github.com/makandra/minidusen) repo.


## Step-by-step integration


### Have a standard gem setup

Gemika expects a standard gem directory that looks roughly like this:

```shell
my_gem.gemspec      # Specification for your gem
Rakefile            # Rake tasks for your gem
lib/my_gem.rb       # Main file to require for your gem
spec/my_gem_spec.rb # Tests for your gem
```

If you don't have a directory yet, you can [ask Bundler to create it for you](http://bundler.io/rubygems.html):

```
bundle gem my_gem
```

This will create a new directory named `my_gem` with your new gem skeleton.


### Install Gemika

Switch to your favorite Ruby version and install the Gemika gem:

```shell
gem install gemika
```

Future contributors to your gem can install Gemika using the Gemfiles we will create below.


### Rake tasks

Add this to your `Rakefile` to gain tasks `matrix:install`, `matrix:spec`, `matrix:update`.

```ruby
begin
  require 'gemika/tasks'
rescue LoadError
  puts 'Run `gem install gemika` for additional tasks'
end
```

Check that the tasks appear with `rake -T`:

```shell
rake current_rspec[files]  # Run specs with the current RSpec version
rake matrix:install        # Install all Ruby 1.8.7 gemfiles
rake matrix:list           # List dependencies for all Ruby 1.8.7 gemfiles
rake matrix:spec[files]    # Run specs for all Ruby 1.8.7 gemfiles
rake matrix:update[gems]   # Update all Ruby 1.8.7 gemfiles
```

We also recommend to make `matrix:spec` the default task in your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
task :default => 'matrix:spec'
```

### Define multiple dependency sets

We are now creating one `Gemfile` for each set of gems and database type you'd like to test again.

First, create a directory for the gemfiles:

```shell
mkdir gemfiles
```

For each dependency set, create a `Gemfile` in the `gemfiles` directory that contains:

1. The runtime dependencies you'd like to test against (e.g. Rails 5)
2. The development dependencies for that set (e.g. `rspec`) in a version that is compatible with these runtime gependencies.
3. The `gemika` gem
4. Your own gem from path `..`
 
For instance, if one dependency set is Rails 3.2 with a MySQL database, we would create `gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2` with these contents:

```ruby
# Runtime dependencies
gem 'rails', '~>3.2.22'
gem 'mysql2', '= 0.3.17'
gem 'rspec', '~> 3.4'

# Development dependencies
gem 'rake'
gem 'byebug'
gem 'gemika'

# Gem under test
gem 'my_gem', :path => '..'
```

If a second dependency is Rails 5.0 with a PostgreSQL database, we would create `gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg` with these contents:

```ruby
# Runtime dependencies
gem 'rails', '~>5.0.0'
gem 'pg', '~>0.18.4'
gem 'rspec', '~>3.5'

# Development dependencies
gem 'rake'
gem 'byebug'
gem 'gemika'

# Gem under test
gem 'my_gem', :path => '..'
```

In this example, your `gemfiles` directory should now look like this:

```
gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2
gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg
```

Create lockfiles for each bundle by running:

```shell
rake matrix:install
```

In this example, your `gemfiles` directory should now contain a lockfile for each gemfile:

```
gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2
gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2.lock
gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg
gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg.lock
```

Gemfiles and lockfiles should be committed to your repo.

Make sure to re-run `rake matrix:install` after each change to your gemfiles, and commit the generated changes.


### Define combinations of gemfiles and Ruby versions

We will now define a test matrix that contains all permutations of gemfiles and tested Ruby versions.

We store the matrix in a `.travis.yml` file, **even if the project is not using Travis CI**. This allows us to configure the matrix once and us it for both local developent and Travis CI builds.

Create a `.travis.yml` that lists all gemfiles and Ruby versions you'd like to test against:

```yaml
rvm:
  - 2.1.8
  - 2.2.4
  - 2.3.1

gemfile:
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.3.2.mysql2
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.pg
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.mysql2
  - gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg
```

Don't mind the `rvm` key if you're using a different version manager locally (like rbenv). Things will still work.


#### Excluding incompatible matrix rows

There might be incompatible combinations of gemfiles and Rubies, e.g. Rails 5.0 does not work with Ruby 2.1 or lower. In this case, add an `matrix`/`exclude` key to your `.travis.yml`:

```yaml
matrix:
  exclude:
    - gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.mysql2
      rvm: 2.1.8
    - gemfile: gemfiles/Gemfile.5.0.pg
      rvm: 2.1.8
```


### Default Ruby and default gemfile

Your project will be more approachable if you're defining a default Ruby and dependency set. This way a developer can make changes and run code without knowing about the test matrix.

Create a `.ruby-version` file with the default Ruby version:

```
2.2.4
```

Choose a default dependency set and symlink both gemfile and lockfile to your project root:

```
ln -s gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2 Gemfile
ln -s gemfiles/Gemfile.4.2.mysql2.lock Gemfile.lock
```

Commit both `.ruby-version` and symlinks to your repo.

We recommend to setup Travis CI (see below) to check the entire test matrix after each push, even if a developer only tested with the defaults.


### Test databases

Create a local test database `my_gem_test` in either MySQL, PostgreSQL or both (depending on what you support). If you want to test against multiple database types, you should have created one gemfile for each type above.

Now create a file `spec/support/database.yml` that contains your local database credentials:

```yaml
mysql:
  database: my_gem_test
  host: localhost
  username: root
  password: secret

postgresql:
  database: minidusen_test
  user:
  password:
```

We don't want to commit our local credentials, so add a line to your `.gitignore`:

```
spec/support/database.yml
```

What we *will* commit is a `database.sample.yml` as a template for future contributors:

```
cp spec/support/database.yml spec/support/database.sample.yml
```

Remember to replace any private passwords in `database.sample.yml` with `secret` before committing.

To have ActiveRecord connect to the database in `database.yml` before your tests, add a file `spec/support/database.rb` with the following content:

```
database = Gemika::Database.new
database.connect
```

Now require Gemika and this support file from your `spec_helper.rb`.

```
require 'gemika'
require 'spec/support/database'
```

Protip: Instead of requiring support files indidually, configure your `spec_helper.rb` to automatically `require` all files in the `spec/support` folder:

```ruby
Dir["#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}/support/*.rb"].sort.each {|f| require f}
```

Now you have a great place for code snippets that need to run before specs (factories, VCR configuration, etc.).


#### Test database schema

If your gem is talking to the database, you probably need to create some example tables.

Gemika lets you define an [ActiveRecord database migration](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html) for that. Before your test suite runs, Gemika will drop *all* tables in your test database and recreate them using this migration.

Add your migration to your `spec/support/database.rb` (created and required above):

```ruby

database = Gemika::Database.new
database.connect
database.rewrite_schema! do

  create_table :users do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.string :email
    t.string :city
  end

  create_table :recipes do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.integer :category_id
  end

  create_table :recipe_ingredients do |t|
    t.string :name
    t.integer :recipe_id
  end

  create_table :recipe_categories do |t|
    t.string :name
  end

end
```

#### Clean database before each test

A very useful Rails default is to wrap every test in a transaction that is rolled back when the example ends. This way each example starts with a blank database.

To get the same behavior in your gem tests, add `database_cleaner` as a development dependency to all your gemfiles:

```ruby
gem 'database_cleaner'
```

If you don't want to configure `database_cleaner` manually, you can ask Gemika to clean the database before each example:

```ruby
Gemika::RSpec.configure_clean_database_before_example
```

Note that you also need `require 'gemika'` in your `spec_helper.rb`.


### Try it out

Check if you can install development dependencies for each row in the test matrix:

```shell
bundle exec rake matrix:install
```

Check if you can run tests for each row in the test matrix:

```shell
bundle exec rake matrix:spec
```

To only run some examples, put the list of files in square brackets (it's a Rake thing):

```shell
bundle exec rake matrix:spec[spec/foo_spec.rb:1005]
```

You should see the command output for each row in the test matrix. Gemika will also print a summary at the end:

![Matrix task output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makandra/gemika/master/doc/minidusen_test.png)

If you now discover compatibility issue with your library, see below how Gemika can help you [bridge incompatibilities between dependency sets](#bridging-incompatibilities-between-dependency-sets).


### Running specs in multiple Ruby versions

Note that there is no task for automatically running all gemfiles in all Ruby versions. We had something like this in earlier versions of Gemika and it wasn't as practical as we thought.

Instead you need to manually switch Ruby versions and re-run:

```shell
rake matrix:install
rake matrix:spec
```

Note that if your current Ruby version is *very* far away from your [default Ruby](#default-ruby-and-default-gemfile) in `.ruby-version`, you might need to run `rake` with a gemfile that has compatible dependencies:

```shell
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile.2.3 bundle exec rake matrix:install
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=gemfiles/Gemfile.2.3 bundle exec rake matrix:spec
```

We recommend to setup Travis CI to check the entire test matrix after each push, including all Rubies. This way developers can stay on the [default Ruby and gemfile](#default-ruby-and-default-gemfile) most of the time while Travis CI checks make sure that nothing broken gets merged.


## Activate Travis CI

We recommend to setup Travis CI to check the entire test matrix after each push. Travis CI will also show the build results on Github's pull request page, helping maintainers decide whether a PR is safe to merge.

If you plan to use Travis CI, also add a `spec/support/database.travis.yml` with [Travis' default database credentials](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/database-setup/):

```yaml
mysql:
  database: my_gem_test
  username: travis
  password:

postgresql:
  database: my_gem_test
  user: postgres
  password:
```

Add options to `.travis.yml` to create databases before running tests:

```yaml
before_script:
  - psql -c 'create database mygem_test;' -U postgres
  - mysql -e 'create database IF NOT EXISTS mygem_test;'
```

Also add the other `.travis.yml` settings required for a Ruby project:

```yaml
language: ruby

sudo: false

cache: bundler

notifications:
  email:
    - notifications@test.com

install:
  # Old Travis CI bundler explodes when lockfile version doesn't match recently bumped version
  - gem install bundler --version='=1.12.5'
  # This is the default Travis CI install step
  - bundle install --jobs=3 --retry=3 --deployment --path=${BUNDLE_PATH:-vendor/bundle}

script: bundle exec rake current_rspec
```

Adjust the `script` option if you're not using RSpec to test your code.


#### Activate Github integration

To activate Travis CI for your Github repo:

- Log into Github
- Open your gem's project page
- Open *Settings*
- Navigate to *Integrations & services*
- Open the *Add service* dropdown
- Select *Travis CI*
- Authenticate via OAuth

To check if the integration has worked, push a change and check if you can see your build matrix on the [Travis CI dashboard](https://travis-ci.org/).

#### Build badge

You might want to a build status badge to your `README.md` like this:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/makandra/gemika.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makandra/gemika)

You can add such a badge using this markdown:

```markdown
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/my_org/my_gem.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/my_org/my_gem)
```

#### Protect the `master` branch

If you're super paranoid you can also prevent anyone from pushing to `master` without a green Travis CI build:

- Open your Github project settings
- Navigate to *Branches*
- Below *Protected branches*, open the *Choose a branch...* dropdown
- Select `master`
- Check *Protect this branch*
- Check *Require status checks to pass before merging*
- Check the status check `continuous-integration/travis-ci`
- Press *Save changes*


## Add development instructions to your README

Your README should contain instructions how to run tests before making a PR. We recommend to add a section like the one below to your `README.md`:

```markdown
## Development

There are tests in `spec`. We only accept PRs with tests. To run tests:

- Install Ruby x.y.z
- Create a local test database `my_gem_test` in both MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Copy `spec/support/database.sample.yml` to `spec/support/database.yml` and enter your local credentials for the test databases
- Install development dependencies using `bundle install`
- Run tests using `bundle exec rspec`

We recommend to test large changes against multiple versions of Ruby and multiple dependency sets. Supported combinations are configured in `.travis.yml`. We provide some rake tasks to help with this:

- Install development dependencies using `bundle matrix:install`
- Run tests using `bundle matrix:spec`

Note that we have configured Travis CI to automatically run tests in all supported Ruby versions and dependency sets after each push. We will only merge pull requests after a green Travis build.
```

Adjust the first part to match what you chose as your [default Ruby and default gemfile](#default-ruby-and-dependency-set).


Bridging incompatibilities between dependency sets
---------------------------------------------------

Gemika can help you bridge incompatibilities or breaking changes between Ruby versions, gem versions, or RSpec.


### Version switches

Check if a gem was activated by the current gemfile:

```ruby
Gemika::Env.gem?('activesupport')
```

Check if a gem was activated and satisfies a version requirement:

```ruby
Gemika::Env.gem?('activesupport', '>= 5')
Gemika::Env.gem?('activesupport', '~> 5.0.0')
Gemika::Env.gem?('activesupport', '< 5')
```

Check if the current Ruby version satisfies a version requirement:

```ruby
Gemika::Env.ruby?('>= 2')
Gemika::Env.ruby?('< 2')
Gemika::Env.ruby?('~> 2.1.0')
```

Check if the process is running as a Travis CI build:

```ruby
Gemika::Env.travis?
```

### RSpec 1 vs. RSpec 2+

If you're testing gems against Rails 2.3 or Ruby 1.8.7 you might need to test with RSpec 1. There are a lot of differences between RSpec 1 and later versions, which Gemika helps to pave over.

Configuring RSpec requires you to work on a different module in RSpec 1 (`Spec::Runner`) and RSpec 2 (just `RSpec`). The following works for all RSpec versions:

```ruby
Gemika::RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.before(:each) do
    # runs before each example
  end

end
```

When your tests need to run with RSpec 1, you need to use the old `should` syntax, which works across all RSpec versions.

To enable this `should` syntax for later RSpecs:

```ruby
Gemika::RSpec.configure_should_syntax
```

RSpec 1 has a binary `spec`, while later RSpecs use `rspec`. To call the correct binary for the current gemfile:

```shell
rake current_rspec
```


Development
-----------

Here are some hints when you try to make changes to Gemika itself:

There are tests in `spec`. We only accept PRs with tests. To run tests:

- Install Ruby 2.2.4
- Create a local test database `gemika_test` in both MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Copy `spec/support/database.sample.yml` to `spec/support/database.yml` and enter your local credentials for the test databases
- Install development dependencies using `bundle install`
- Run tests using `bundle exec rspec`

We recommend to test large changes against multiple versions of Ruby and multiple dependency sets. Supported combinations are configured in `.travis.yml`. We provide some rake tasks to help with this:

- Install development dependencies using `bundle matrix:install`
- Run tests using `bundle matrix:spec`

Note that we have configured Travis CI to automatically run tests in all supported Ruby versions and dependency sets after each push. We will only merge pull requests after a green Travis build.
